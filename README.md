# EMSI-Dataset
# 🇬🇧 UK Job Change Analysis (EMSI Dataset)

Welcome to my exploration of the **EMSI Job Change UK** dataset—a comprehensive Excel workbook analyzing employment shifts across industries, regions, and occupations. This project transforms raw labor market data into strategic insights for workforce planning, policy evaluation, and economic forecasting.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This workbook showcases my ability to clean, structure, and analyze complex datasets using Excel’s full analytical toolkit. From formula-driven logic to dynamic pivot tables, I’ve built a scalable framework for understanding job growth, decline, and sectoral transitions across the UK.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- **📊 Data Structuring & Cleaning**
  - Organized multi-sheet data for clarity and consistency
  - Applied filters and sorting to surface key trends and outliers

- **📈 Sector & Regional Analysis**
  - Compared job change metrics across industries and UK regions
  - Flagged high-growth and high-risk sectors for strategic review

- **📤 Reporting & Visualization**
  - Created summary dashboards for quick insights
  - Used conditional formatting to highlight growth hotspots and decline zones

## 🧮 Excel Techniques Used

### 🔗 Cell Referencing
- Applied **absolute and relative references** to build scalable formulas across sheets
- Linked summary views to raw data using structured references
- Used **named ranges** for clarity and formula reusability

### 🧠 Functions & Formulas
- Leveraged key functions including:
  - `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`, `COUNTIF`, `INDEX`, `MATCH`
  - `TEXT`, `ROUND`, `RANK` for formatting and ranking logic
- Built **nested formulas** to calculate net job change, growth percentages, and sectoral comparisons
- Used **logical functions** to flag priority sectors and regions

### 📊 Pivot Tables
- Created pivot tables to summarize:
  - Job change by industry, region, and occupation
  - Growth vs. decline trends over time
- Used slicers and filters for interactive exploration
- Applied `GETPIVOTDATA` for dynamic referencing in dashboards

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified top 5 growing sectors and regions by net job change
- Flagged declining industries for policy attention and retraining initiatives
- Built a reusable framework for future EMSI data imports and analysis

## 💡 Why This Matters

This isn’t just an Excel workbook—it’s a strategic lens into the UK labor market. By combining analytical rigor with creative formatting, I’ve built a tool that supports smarter workforce decisions and economic planning.
